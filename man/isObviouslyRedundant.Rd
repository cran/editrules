\description{
  Find obvious redundancies in set of edits

  Lower-level method, to be called directly from internal
  functions of the editrules package.

  Normalizes the editmatrix if necessary, converts it and
  passes it to the \code{matrix} method. All options of the
  \code{matrix} method may be passed. Obvious redundancies,
  amounting to statements as 0==0 or 0 < 1 will be
  detected, as well as duplicates.

  Check if any of the variables has FALSE for every
  category (a record can never be contained in such a set).
