#' Package editrules
#'
#' Facilitates reading and manipulation of linear
#' (in)equalities, converting them into matrix format (and vice versa)
#' and checking if data are valid according to these rules. Sets of
#' linear edits can be manipulated using Fourier-Motzkin elimination
#' and variable substitution and solving error localization problems
#' based on the generalized principle of Felligi and Holt.
#' 
#' The \code{editrules} package aims to provide an environment to conveniently
#' define, read and check linear (in)equality restrictions, perform common rule
#' set manipulations and offer error localization functionality based on the
#' (generalized) paradigm of Fellegi and Holt. This paradigm assumes that errors
#' are distributed randomly over the variables and there is no detectable cause of
#' error. It also decouples the detection of corrupt variables from their
#' correction.  For some types of error, such as sign flips, typing errors or
#' rounding errors, this assumption does not hold. These errors can be detected
#' and are closely related to their resolution. The reader is referred to the
#' package \code{deducorrect} package for treating such errors. 
#'
#'
#' Typical usage is:
#' @example ../examples/editrules.R
#' @name editrules-package 
#' @docType package
